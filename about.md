## Hi there!

### My name is Wojtek (like **VOI**ce and **TECH**nology).

I'm software engineer at [Metro Markets GmbH](https://www.metro-markets.de/). For everyday work I'm member of software operations team. My main focus is how to make developer experience of my colleagues as smooth as possible.

### For daily work, I do:
* analysis if proposed tools can by useful in our daily work;
* support teams with some coding / advisory if needed;
* mentoring;
* support people team by joining "live coding" step of recruitment process;

### Little bit about me:
* still lover of PHP (10++ years);
* big RUST enthusiast ðŸ¤©;
* I love my two cats and wife;
* amateur [photographer](https://insidepumpkin.com/);
* bass ðŸŽ¸ player [@ Josito And The Kids](https://www.instagram.com/jositoandthekids/);

### Here I'm writing down my findings for later usage. Maybe someone will find it useful.
